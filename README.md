              which notes are played.

/gongjinou/ - Plays "Gong Jin Ou," the Qing national anthem. Uses 5 LEDs as a
              pitch analyzer.

/rain/      - Plays "Rain" from Xian Jian. Uses a serial shifter and digital
              LED to display note names as they are played. The decimal point
              indicates sharps.
